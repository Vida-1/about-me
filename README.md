## Lab 03
      ### This lab adds the folllowing features.....

      * Guide user to an answer through a series of feedback responses to learn more about the site owner.
      * Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
      * Indicates through an alert if the guess is ‚Äútoo high‚Äù or ‚Äútoo low‚Äù.
      * It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
      * After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.

      * Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
      * Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
      * The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
      * Display all the possible correct answers to the user. 
      * Keep track of the total number of correct answers & at the end tell how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
