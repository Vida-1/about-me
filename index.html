  <h1>About me...</h1>
</header>
  <main padding:20px>
    <p align:justify>Mellow greetings from North Carolina (Eastern time zone)! I'm Vida (she/her), Mom to four furkids, and pandemic-inspired homeschooler of two (nephews) with a passion for Star Trek, canine rescue, and learning coding. My background is in online support services providing support in retail accounting, commercial real estate underwriting, logistics, and canine rescue.</p>
    
    <p align:justify>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies, with concentrations in mathematics and English, an Associate of Science, focus on the pure sciences, and I hold a bartender certification from a past life of oh so many awesome memories! I love learning new things and am excited about taking part in this software development program as I've long had an interest in learning to code and the stars have finally aligned for me to have an opportunity to do so! I look forward to securing a position that will allow me to utilize and continually expand upon my coding skillset in the XR space.</p>
